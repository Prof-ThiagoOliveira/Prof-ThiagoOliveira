I hold a PhD in Statistics from the <a href="https://www.esalq.usp.br/"> the University of São Paulo</a>, Brazil, and have at least eight years of experience in experimental statistics and statistical modelling. As a PhD student, in 2016, I was a visiting Scholar at the <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/">National University of Ireland Galway</a>, Ireland, where I worked with statistical modelling in agricultural data. Moreover, I worked as a lecturer in the Department of Exact Sciences at ESALQ/University of São Paulo, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil, from 2017 to 2019.

I also worked as a Researcher Biostatistician from 2019-2020 at <a href="https://www.insight-centre.org/">Insight Centre for Data Analytics</a> in partnership with <a href="https://www.orreco.com/">Orreco</a>, School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Applied Mathematics, and NUI Galway in the development of statistical methods applied to athlete performance, and predictive models for COVID-19. I developed statistical methods in longitudinal concordance correlation, multilevel model (hierarchical model), generalized linear mixed-effects model, state-space models, experimental design, longitudinal data.

As an enthusiast of using dashboard apps to create an interactive data visualization, I believe apps are easier to make visual representations of large scale data sets. It also allows the user to explore the complex reality of the database or even handle multiple data locations in a single visualization.
